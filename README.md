# Why to contribute Open Source project?

Motivation of the project is to find some answers about opensource contributions.
For this purpose stackoverflow survey data is analysed.

As all we know, there are various open source projects and they are getting popular day by day.
But always I wonder why people contribute to open source projects. Do have any idea?
I have analyzed stack-overflow developer survey in order to find answers.
